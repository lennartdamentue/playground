There's a production line, where there are two steps:

1. people put bottles on a production belt
2. people put caps on the bottles that are moving on the belt

You can control the number of seconds it takes for the bottle to go
from step 1 to step 2 (called buffer time).

The time it takes for people to put a new bottle on the line AND
the time to put a cap on the bottle is stochastic, given by some
probability density functions (they may be different). These pdf's are
already given.

If more than <some number> of bottles are stuck in step 2 at
the same time, the production belt breaks and you have lost
the game.

The goal is to maximize the number of bottles produced,
while losing the game less than <some number> percent of
the times.

You can do this by Simulation.
